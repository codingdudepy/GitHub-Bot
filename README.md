# GitHub Website
The <a href="https://githubdatacollection.herokuapp.com/">GitHub website</a> is fairly easy to use I used heroku to deploy but you can use any hosting service you want that works with flask. However, for heroku if you want to use it please install all the files in the folder. If your not using heroku you can delete the following files:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Procfile</li>
  <li>wsgi.py</li>
  <li>requirements.txt</li>
</ul>
